# Traces and norms of symmetric bilinear forms @ M2 Madison
![status](https://github.com/Macaulay2/Workshop-2025-Madison/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=BilinearForms)

## Overview
We will implement some new features into the existing `A1BrouwerDegrees` package relating to traces and norms, and the computation of unstable A1 degrees. The Overleaf document TO BE ADDED spells out the tasks in more detail. 

## Useful commands 
A base repository containing the existing `A1BrouwerDegrees` package has been set up as `A1Madison`. Before pushing from your local device, please check that you have not broken any of the previously written tests by running 

```check A1Madison```
