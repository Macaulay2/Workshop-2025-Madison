			<p >
			  Our aim is to learn and contribute in a supportive environment where all participants feel welcome, safe, and included. We encourage everyone in the workshop to actively help in creating such spaces, either in person or online and during or after the workshop, in order to help us all learn, use, and contribute to Macaulay2 together.<br><br>


We are committed to creating a workshop which is welcoming to all participants regardless of gender identity and expression, nationality, ethnicity, race, religion, age, disability, mathematical background, or any other factor. As such, we will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment. Given the diversity of folks joining us, please remember to be mindful of the fact that some words and behaviors may be offensive to some even if they are not to others. We therefore ask that all participants take care to be respectful to one another.<br><br>


If a participant engages in any form of discriminatory or harassing behavior, workshop organizers may take any action that is deemed appropriate at the time. If you are being harassed, made to feel uncomfortable with the way you are being treated, notice someone else being harassed, or if you have any other concerns, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLRaCM-jE2rPPHIMBAh-bQoGNrm48uZa0RxeHjOe7Ozmd5NQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=104191227075308518226">this anonymous form</a>.<br><br>

All reports will be handled in confidentiality and will be taken seriously.</p>

				Here are some further advice to keep in mind.<br>
<b>Move up, move back:</b>
<ul>
	<li>If you usually don’t share much, challenge yourself to share more;</li>
	<li	>If you find yourself sharing more than others, challenge yourself to listen more.</li>
</ul>
<b>Practice active listening:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Listen to understand, not to respond.</li>
	<li	>Listen without judgment, with the intent of understanding the speaker;</li>
	<li>Wait until people have made their complete point before formulating a response.</li>
</ul>
<b>Participate to the fullest of your ability</b>
<ul>
	<li>Invite discomfort, challenge yourself, and seek opportunities for growth.</li>
</ul>
<b>No one knows everything; everyone knows something; together we know a lot:</b>
<ul>
	<li>We are all learners and have different life experiences;</li>
	<li>We can all learn from each other without putting down anyone in the group.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>Acknowledgement:</b> This agreement is based on the community agreement created by the ECCO organizers for the “Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria" conference and the QTMC organizers for the “Queer and Trans Mathematicians in Combinatorics” conference.
