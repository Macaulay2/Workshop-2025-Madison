things to update:

  1. change how isSymmetric Matrix works (use sets)
  2. update partitionToPermutation
  3. `hStarPolynomial(Polytope,Matrix) = H_P^*` where $H_P^*$ comes from the equivariant Ehrhart series $EES_P = \frac{H_P^*(t)}{\det(I - t \rho)}$ with $\rho$ the natural representation of group generated by the matrix $g$.
  4. Need a way to construct the _entire_ group generated by a list of generators. In particular, the cyclic group generated by $g$.
  5. Compute $P_{g^i}$, the polytope fixed by $g^i$, as well as its Ehrhart series.
  6. Look at $\mathfrak{S}_n$ case to put these Ehrhart series together to obtain $H_P^*$.
